This document describes how to get the 'BB model' (Bicanski and Burgess 2018, eLife) 
up and running to simulate various aspects of spatial cognition/memory.

REF

Please read the file 'ReadmeFirst' first (duh) before proceeding.

All scripts/functions fall into one of four categories. 

1. Preparatory scripts have filenames starting with 'BB_prep...'. 
These scripts set up variables for the environment the simulated 
agent moves in, calculate connection weights etc. Creating these 
weights corresponds to the 'training phase' mentioned in the paper.

2. Once all setup has been completed the script 'BB_main.m' can be run. 
This is the (surprise, surprise) main script which runs the simulation 
of whatever aspect of cognition you chose to simulate. The type of 
simulation is set by the variable 'simflag'. 

3. Scripts with filenames that start with 'BB_subr...' are 
subroutines, called by BB_main.

4. Scripts with filenames that start with 'BB_plt...' do the 
plotting/visualitation of neural activity.  

Enjoy!
