This document describes how to get the 'BB model' (Bicanski and Burgess 2018, eLife) up and running to simulate various aspects of pstial cognition/memory.

REF

The model implementation is in part based on previous code (Byrne, Becker, Burgess, 2007), the 'BBB model', and I have retained some conventions introduced there. 

Byrne P, Becker S, Burgess N. Remembering the past and imagining the future: a neural model of spatial memory and imagery. Psychological review. 2007 Apr;114(2):340.

The code provided comes with no warranty etc. and you use it at your own risk. Furthermore it is licenced under the GPL. YOu are free to re-use and copy the code, but attribution must be correctly given.

Please note, in writing the code I have focused on readbilty/understadability, not conciseness and/or efficiency. The code runs even on modest hardware as it is, but if you are stickler for the most concise and efficient code, be brave and seek help.

I have done my best to use self-explanatory variable names and to annotate the code. If something remains cryptic its, of course, your fault but I will happily assist. Please do not hesitate to contact me.
