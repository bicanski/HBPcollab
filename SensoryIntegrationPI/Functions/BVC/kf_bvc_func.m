%% BVC firing function

% sigR(d) = ((d/beta) + 1)*sig0
%
% In Barry and Burgess (2007), values are sigA = 0.2 radians, beta = 1830 mm, and sig0 = 122 mm.
%
% The preferred firing direction (phi) for each BVC set was selected randomly from the continuous range 0ï¿½2pi.
%
% The preferred firing distance (d) for each BVC set was selected randomly from the following values:
% 81.0, 169.0, 265.0, 369.0, 482.5, 606.5, and 741.0 mm.
% It can be seen that BVCs with shorter preferred ?ring distance, and hence narrower tuning curves, are more densely represented.
%
% sigR - radial firing variance
% r - allocentric radial distance
% d - tuning distance
% the - current angle to boundary
% phi - tuning angle

% Simulate a multi-layered neural network that has head direction inputs at
% the bottom in addition to head direction sensitive BVC inputs. Hopefully,
% grid cells come out at the bottom that are directionally sensitive
% (conjunctive GCs), whereas they lose direction sensitivity as we go up
% the layers.
%
% In a biological sense, the directional sensitivity is inherent in the BVC
% representations since they're likely to be visually driven, and so it's
% necessary to include it in the model. However, it's not clear whether
% there is a functional advantage to directional snesitity in GCs if
% they're only meant as a coding mechanism. So, if they get more stable as
% we go from presubiculum (PrS) to parasubiculum (PaS) to mEC, they might
% lose their directional sensitivity.
