This repo contains the code for the 'BB model' (Bicanski and Burgess 2018, eLife), 
which allows you to simulate various aspects of spatial cognition/memory.

DOI: 10.7554/eLife.33752

The model implementation is in part based on previous code (Byrne, Becker, Burgess, 2007), 
the 'BBB model', and I have retained some conventions introduced there. 

Byrne P, Becker S, Burgess N. Remembering the past and imagining the future: 
a neural model of spatial memory and imagery. Psychological review. 2007 Apr;114(2):340.

The code provided comes with no warranty etc. and you use it at your own risk. 
Furthermore it is licenced under the GPL. You are free to re-use and copy the 
code, but attribution must be correctly given.

Please note, in writing the code I have focused on readbilty/understadability, 
not conciseness and/or efficiency. The code runs even on modest hardware as it 
is. If you are stickler for the most concise and efficient code, be brave.

I have done my best to use self-explanatory variable names and to annotate the code. 
If something remains cryptic I will happily assist. Please do not hesitate to contact me.
